# Awesome-Machine-Learning 
This repository contains examples of popular machine learning algorithms implemented in Python with mathematics behind them being explained. Each algorithm has interactive Jupyter Notebook demo that allows you to play with training data, algorithms configurations and immediately see the results, charts and predictions right in your browser. In most cases the explanations are based on this great machine learning course by Andrew Ng.

The purpose of this repository is not to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That's why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.
