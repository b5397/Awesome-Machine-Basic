# Linear Regression : ![](https://github.com/b5397/Awesome-Machine-Basic/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning/Linear%20Regression/Images/Linear_regression.png)
**Linear regression is one of the ways to perform predictive analysis. It is used to examine regression estimates.**

The regression estimates explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The same is represented in the below equation.
The formula for linear Regression:

y = mx + c


Why we Use Linear Regression?
Linear regression is used to perform regression analysis. Below are the uses of regression analysis.
Help determine the strength of Predictors: This technique is used in sales and marketing.  Predictive analysis helps in understanding the relationship between the predictor and outcome variable (i.e. dose and effect).
Forecast the effect through Prediction: The change in the dependent variable will cause a difference in an independent variable.  For example, if you spend more money on marketing a product it can affect the sales to increase or decrease.
Trend Analysis / Forecasting: Regression analysis is used to predict future trends especially in the share market where there are fluctuations and inflation in prices.
Types of Linear Regression
Below are the 5 types of Linear regression:

1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple regression has one dependent variable (interval or ratio), one independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous). The example can be measuring a child’s height every year of growth. The usual growth is 3 inches. Many such real-world examples can be categorized under simple linear regression.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple regression is used when we have two independent variables and one dependent variable. We can determine what effect the independent variables have on a dependent variable.


In Multiple regression, we can suppose x to be a series of independent variables (x1, x2 …) and Y to be a dependent variable. We also have b as the slope of a regression variable. Below is the equation that represents the relation between x and y.

Y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + …
The example that can be categorized under multiple regression is calculating blood pressure where the independent variables can be height, weight, amount of exercise. The selection of variables is also important while performing multiple regression analysis. We should understand are important variables and unimportant variables before we create a model.


**Problem Statement:**
To build a machine learning model and predict the salary of the employees based on year of experience
Dataset description
This dataset is randomly created to show you how we can use machine learning technique and build a Linear Regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on years of experience.
This dataset consists of two columns
Salary- Represent the salary of a person.
Years- Years of experience
